<h3>What to bring to the party</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Streamers: Great for hanging around the room, and you can even fold them into patterns.</li>
    <li>Banners: A big “Happy Birthday” banner or feature banner related to the party theme.</li>
    <li>Party Blowers: These honking toys may be annoying for adults, but kids love them.</li>
    <li>Party Hats: These come in a variety of colors and themes and are also age-specific</li>
    <li>Confetti: Although usually seen at weddings, it can be a great addition to a birthday party or to put in a piñata.</li>
</ul>
